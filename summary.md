# CONCLUSION

This project successfully demonstrated how to set up a fully functional `LEMP stack` environment on a cloud-based server using Ubuntu. Through hands-on exercises, I mastered key concepts in server provisioning, web server configuration, database management, and dynamic scripting.

I am now confident in deploying a modern web application architecture that combines high performance **(Nginx)**, robust data handling **(MySQL)**, and flexibility **(PHP)**, all hosted securely on a virtual machine in the cloud.
